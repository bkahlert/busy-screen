## Installation steps

- Install Ansible on your computer.
- Checkout this repository:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/bkahlert/busy-screen.git
  cd busy-screen/ansible
  ```
- Install Ansible requirements:
  ```shell
  ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
  ```
- Copy the [sample inventory](inventory/sample) to `inventory/berries` and adapt it to your needs:
  ```shell
  cp -r inventory/sample inventory/berries
  ```

to your SD card.

- Boot your Raspberry Pi and connect it to your network.
- A Raspberry Pi with an ARMv6Z instruction set (Pi 1A, 1A+, 1B, 1B+, Zero, Zero W),
  requires a compatible Chromium browser that is not available in the current
  Raspberry Pi OS.  
  Therefore, you need to:
    - use [Raspberry Pi OS Lite 10 (buster)](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2021-05-28/), **or**
    - install the old Chromium browser manually (tested
      on [Raspberry Pi OS Lite 11 (bullseye)](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2023-05-03/)):
      ```shell
      echo 'deb http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/ buster main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buster.list
      sudo apt update
      apt list -a chromium-browser
      sudo apt-get install -y chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra=92.0.4515.98~buster-rpt2
      sudo apt-get install -y chromium-codecs-ffmpeg=92.0.4515.98~buster-rpt2
      sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser=92.0.4515.98~buster-rpt2
      sudo apt-mark hold chromium-browser
      ```
- Start the installation using:
  ```shell
  # Setup only the device foo.local
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml -l foo.local
  
  # Setup only the device foo.local declared in the given inventory, and use the specified IP address to connect
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml -l foo.local \
      -e "ansible_host=10.10.10.99" \
      -i inventory/other/hosts.yml
  ```
  or in combination with [Pi Hero](https://github.com/bkahlert/pihero):
  ```shell
  # Setup only the device foo.local
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags busyscreen,pihero -l foo.local
  
  # Setup only the device foo.local declared in the given inventory, and use the specified IP address to connect
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags busyscreen,pihero -l foo.local \
      -e "ansible_host=10.10.10.99" \
      -i inventory/other/hosts.yml
  ```

## Optional steps

### Disable Wi-Fi

If you don't have a Wi-Fi interface, or just don't want to use it, you can disable the appropriate service.
This speeds up the boot process and reduces the number of log errors.

```shell
sudo systemctl stop hostapd
sudo systemctl disable hostapd
```
